## Supported Versions

Currently supported versions for security updates:

| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Overview

The Client Data Manager is designed with security as a primary concern, particularly for protecting sensitive client information such as passwords and database credentials.

## Security Features

### 1. Data Encryption
- **Algorithm**: Fernet (AES 128 in CBC mode with HMAC for authentication)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256, 100,000 iterations
- **Salt**: Randomly generated per installation
- **Encrypted Fields**: 
  - Hosting service passwords
  - Database passwords
  - Any other sensitive credentials

### 2. Local Data Storage
- **No Cloud Storage**: All data is stored locally on the user's machine
- **No Network Transmission**: Sensitive data never leaves the local system
- **SQLite Database**: Single-file database with file system permissions

### 3. Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: No web interface for user data display (desktop only)

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Local File Access
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: The database file is stored locally and could be accessed by other users on the same system or by malware.
**Mitigation**: 
- Use appropriate file system permissions
- Consider full-disk encryption for additional protection
- Regular system security updates

### 2. Memory-Based Attacks
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium
**Description**: Decrypted passwords are temporarily stored in memory and could potentially be accessed by memory dump attacks.
**Mitigation**:
- Minimize time sensitive data stays in memory
- Use secure string handling where possible
- Consider memory protection mechanisms

### 3. Key Storage
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: The encryption key is derived from a master password/salt combination stored on the local system.
**Current State**: Uses system-specific key derivation
**Recommendation**: Consider implementing user-specific master password for additional security layer

### 4. Executable Security
**Risk Level**: Low
**Description**: PyInstaller executables might be flagged by antivirus software or could be reverse-engineered.
**Mitigation**:
- Code signing certificates for distribution
- Regular security scanning of build process
- Consider executable packing/protection

## Potential Vulnerabilities

### 1. Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Status**: Monitored
**Description**: Third-party dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities.
**Current Dependencies**:
- `cryptography` (encryption library)
- `sqlalchemy` (database ORM)
- `ttkbootstrap` (GUI framework)
- `flask` (API framework)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Pinned versions in production builds

### 2. GUI-Based Attacks
**Risk Level**: Low
**Description**: Malicious input through GUI forms could potentially cause issues.
**Mitigation**:
- Input length limitations
- Character set validation
- Proper error handling

### 3. Database Injection
**Risk Level**: Low
**Description**: Despite using SQLAlchemy ORM, improper query construction could lead to SQL injection.
**Mitigation**:
- Exclusive use of ORM methods
- No raw SQL queries
- Input validation at application layer

## Security Best Practices for Users

### 1. System Security
- Keep your operating system updated
- Use reputable antivirus software
- Ensure proper user account permissions
- Consider full-disk encryption

### 2. Application Usage
- Download only from official sources
- Verify executable signatures when available
- Use strong, unique passwords for client accounts
- Regularly backup your data directory

### 3. Data Handling
- Limit access to the application data directory
- Be cautious when sharing or transferring database files
- Consider additional encryption for backup files
- Regularly review stored client information

## Development Security Guidelines

### 1. Code Security
```python
# Always encrypt sensitive data before storage
password = encrypt_password(user_input_password)

# Use parameterized queries through ORM
client = session.query(Client).filter(Client.name == name).first()

# Validate all inputs
def validate_email(email):
    if not email or len(email) > 255:
        raise ValueError("Invalid email format")
    return email.strip()

# Handle errors securely
try:
    decrypted = decrypt_password(encrypted_data)
except Exception:
    # Don't leak encryption details in errors
    raise ValueError("Unable to decrypt data")
```

### 2. Configuration Security
- Never commit encryption keys or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper key rotation mechanisms
- Regular security reviews of configuration files

### 3. Build Security
- Verify build environment integrity
- Use official Python packages only
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Sign executables for distribution

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Client Data Manager, please report it responsibly:

### Preferred Method
Create a private security advisory on GitHub:
1. Go to the [Security](https://github.com/artchsh/fullstack-dev-crm/security) tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### Information to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (1-4 weeks)
- **Release**: Security fixes are prioritized

## Security Update Process
